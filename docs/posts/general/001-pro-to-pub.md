# From Procrastination to Publication: The Winding Road to My First Blog Post

I’ve been meaning to start a blog since... well, let’s just say since dinosaurs roamed the internet. Every few months, I’d get this burst of inspiration, followed by the inevitable question that brought everything to a screeching halt:

<strong>“But… how do I actually set up a blog?”</strong>

<!-- more -->

Like any aspiring blogger, I dipped my toes into the usual suspects — Blogger, WordPress, and a few other “just sign up and start writing!” platforms. But they felt a little...meh. Functional, yes. Inspiring? Not really. It was like trying to write a novel on a tax form.

So, in a moment of caffeine-fueled ambition, I declared:

<strong>“I’ll build my own blog site! From scratch! Like a real developer!”</strong>

Spoiler alert: I did start building it. And yes, it was kinda cool. I learned stuff. I wrote code. I felt like a tech wizard — until I realized that instead of writing actual blog posts, I was knee-deep in font pairings and color palettes, obsessing over whether lavender goes with burnt orange (it doesn’t).

Three hours, several questionable design choices, and a site that looked like a unicorn exploded. Later, I proudly showed my creation to my daughters. They gave me that supportive-but-concerned smile — the one that says “Good job, Mom... but also... what is that?”

Eventually, I stumbled upon two promising options: Hugo and MkDocs.

Hugo? Super powerful, but also super overwhelming. I tried a few templates, but nothing clicked. It felt like trying to decorate a mansion when all I needed was a cozy corner.

Then came <strong>MkDocs</strong>. It had a few quirks (like a cat that knocks things off your desk just to watch you pick them up), but once I got the hang of it, it felt clean, customizable, and surprisingly simple. And just like that — we had a winner!

So here I am, finally writing <strong>my first blog post</strong> — not about some profound life philosophy or earth-shattering idea, but about how I finally stopped fussing and chose a tool to start writing. Baby steps, right?

If you’re like me — dreaming of writing but stuck in the “how do I start?” spiral — trust me, just pick something, roll with it, and give yourself permission to start small. The rest will follow. (Just maybe avoid the unicorn-explosion color scheme.)
