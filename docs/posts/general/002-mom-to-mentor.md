# Mom to Mentor: A Plot Twist I Never Saw Coming

If you'd told me ten years ago that I’d go from juggling snack boxes and story time to reviewing pull requests and mentoring junior developers, I would’ve laughed out loud—probably while picking glitter out of my hair or stepping on a Lego barefoot.

But here I am. And the journey? Not exactly linear. More like one of those twisty-turny GPS routes that say, "Recalculating..." every five minutes.

This is the story of how motherhood didn’t pause my career—it transformed it. How years spent nurturing tiny humans gave me the tools, grit, and unexpected insights to help nurture fellow professionals in tech.

Let’s rewind a bit.

## The Great Pause (or So I Thought)

Like many women, I took a career break when my kids were young. It wasn’t a decision I made lightly—more like one made while holding a baby in one arm and Googling “how to survive toddler tantrums” with the other. I figured I’d step away for a bit and return once things “settled down.”

Spoiler: things never really settle down when you’re a mom. The chaos just evolves. From nap schedules to homework battles, from building Lego castles to assembling Ikea furniture (same skill set, if you ask me).

Still, there was always that quiet voice in the back of my head: You’re not done yet. There’s more you can build, contribute, create. And deep down, I knew that motherhood didn’t erase my ambitions—it just reframed them.
