# Mom to Mentor: A Plot Twist I Never Saw Coming

If you'd told me ten years ago that I’d go from juggling snack boxes and story time to reviewing pull requests and mentoring junior developers, I would’ve laughed out loud—probably while picking glitter out of my hair or stepping on a Lego barefoot.

But here I am. And the journey? Not exactly linear. More like one of those twisty-turny GPS routes that say, "Recalculating..." every five minutes.

This is the story of how motherhood didn’t pause my career—it transformed it. How years spent nurturing tiny humans gave me the tools, grit, and unexpected insights to help nurture fellow professionals in tech.

Let’s rewind a bit.

## The Great Pause (or So I Thought)

Like many women, I took a career break when my kids were young. It wasn’t a decision I made lightly—more like one made while holding a baby in one arm and Googling “how to survive toddler tantrums” with the other. I figured I’d step away for a bit and return once things “settled down.”

Spoiler: things never really settle down when you’re a mom. The chaos just evolves. From nap schedules to homework battles, from building Lego castles to assembling Ikea furniture (same skill set, if you ask me).

Still, there was always that quiet voice in the back of my head: You’re not done yet. There’s more you can build, contribute, create. And deep down, I knew that motherhood didn’t erase my ambitions—it just reframed them.

## Rediscovering Myself (Through Curiosity and Code)

Somewhere between school drop-offs and bedtime stories, I started tinkering again. A little coding here. A side project there. Late-night online courses when the house was finally quiet.

What started as a flicker of curiosity grew into a steady flame. I realized I missed tech. I missed solving problems, building things, and the thrill of figuring something out after hours of frustration (and coffee). I started treating my return to tech like a mini mission: upskill, build confidence, find my groove again.

And trust me—it wasn’t all smooth sailing.

There were moments I doubted myself. Tech had evolved while I was away. New frameworks, new buzzwords, new everything. But slowly, as I reconnected with the community and started contributing again, I realized I brought something new to the table too.

## From Mom Brain to Mentor Brain

Motherhood is the ultimate crash course in multitasking, empathy, resilience, and communication under pressure (ever tried negotiating with a 4-year-old? You should be given a UN peacekeeping badge).

These weren’t “soft” skills. They were <strong>superpowers</strong>.

When I started mentoring juniors and collaborating with teammates, I noticed how those very skills transferred seamlessly. My ability to:

<ul>
<li>Listen patiently</li>
<li>Explain things clearly</li>
<li>Celebrate small wins</li>
<li>Coach through failures</li>
</ul>

...was directly shaped by my years as a mom.

Mentoring didn’t feel like a job. It felt like an extension of what I already loved doing—encouraging, guiding, and helping someone become their best self.

## Lessons from the Playroom (That Work in the Boardroom)

You’d be surprised how many leadership lessons come from parenting:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Emotional intelligence matters.</strong> Just like kids, your team members have off days. Understanding that people need space, support, or just someone to listen goes a long way.</li>
    <li><strong>Positive reinforcement works wonders.</strong> Celebrate progress, not just perfection. A “well done!” can motivate more than a performance review ever could.</li>
    <li><strong>Boundaries are healthy.</strong> Whether it’s bedtime routines or work-life balance, setting expectations and sticking to them builds trust.</li>
    <li><strong>Curiosity drives learning.</strong> Kids ask “why?” a thousand times a day. Encouraging that same curiosity in your team keeps innovation alive.</li>
</ul>
