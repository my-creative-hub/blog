ðŸ§  Final Thoughts

Load balancing is not just a network trickâ€”it's a foundational system design skill that affects scalability, reliability, and user experience. By understanding L4 vs L7, algorithms, OSI layers, and specialized methods, you build the foundation to design systems that scale globally and perform gracefully under pressure.

Next up: Weâ€™ll dive into real-world load balancing services like AWS ALB vs NLB vs ELB and explore when to use what. Stay tuned!
